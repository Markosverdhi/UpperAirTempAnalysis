General information
How to run:
1. Ensure that both the main file and the xlsx file are in the same project folder in order to run the code properly
2. Run the code as normal and wait for the UI to load
3. Once the UI loads choose the start/end dates (month and year), the type of anomaly, tropospheric or stratospheric data, and the graph you want to represent the data
4. Close the UI window to easily stop the code 
5. If interested in reading the code, notes should provide enough idea to figure out what each method does
